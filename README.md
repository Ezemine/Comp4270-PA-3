 C Project for Operating Systems on how OS's deal with tasks

The goal of this project was to see the difference between two approaches that an Operating System could take for tasks.
The first is First in First Out (FIFO) method which focuses on a single task until it is complete.
The second is Shortest Job First (SJF) method which changes tasks depending on how much longer the task takes to complete.
